This is my notes for COMP90049 Introduction to Machine Learning
This is such an interesting subject with probs, stats, models.
Some links in the pdf are wrong, refer to page number instead
main.pdf and main.md are contents from 1-6
main2 is whole semester
Do not no what to add for SVM in week 5. This more like an very abstract content to me
